  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    With an academic background in Machine Learning and Computational Biology, I currently work as a Senior AI scientist in the Foundation Model Research team at SAP. My work focuses on fine-tuning large language models and building Generative AI Applications. I currently lead the Data Science team at SAP, where we build AI assistants for ABAP developers.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My academic research focused on developing statistical and machine learning models (NLP) based on high-throughput sequencing datasets to better understand biological systems.

    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I like spending my free time hiking, reading popular science books, and playing board games.
    The pandemic encouraged me to rediscover my painting passion.
