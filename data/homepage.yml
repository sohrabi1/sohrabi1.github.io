  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I love exploring large datasets to gain knowledge.
    My research has focused on designing customized ML frameworks and working with biological data. I very much enjoy 
    venturing into a new field, collaborating across disciplines, playing with data visualizations, 
    and learning new technologies.

    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I like spending my free time hiking, reading popular science books, and playing board games. 
    The pandemic encouraged me to rediscover my painting passion.
